Warehouse Management System inspired by one that I had to use for a job. Uses react native's camera capabilities to scan
barcodes. I plan on adding a desktop part as well to more finely manage some features. This is mostly "Vibe coded" (gross),
but I plan on learning the syntax and structure, and maybe refactor it when I'm wiser.

--TODO--
Mobile (React Native):
- update quantity (and location)
- generate custom barcodes
- start orders
- switch between light and dark modes

Desktop (React):
- update all information about item
- add orders
- view current orders being filled
- manage accounts
- view item information
